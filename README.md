During this time, Germany experienced a pronounced heat wave. 
Between an extensive low-pressure complex over the near northeast Atlantic and strong high pressure over Central
and Eastern Europe, hot to very hot subtropical air from northern Africa and the Sahara was brought to Germany. 
As a result, temperatures rose successively as early as June 25 and 26, 2019. On June 25, 2019, 
maximum values beyond 35 degrees Celsius were measured in places. The station in DÃ¼sseldorf (Nordrhein-Westfalen) was the frontrunner with 36.8 degrees.
However, 36.7 degrees were also recorded in Bad Kreuznach in Rhineland-Palatinate.
